## General info
I conduct lessons for a small class of 15 students and handle consults and grading of assignments for the module.
<br />
Topics Covered: Data Visualization, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Time Series Analysis, Hypothesis Testing

## Basics of R
**In this first lab session, the learning objectives are:**
<br />
- To be able to download and install R and R Studio
- Familiarisation with the R studio interface and be able to create an R script file, open and export data files
- To know some common functions used to do quick checks on the dataset
- To be able to do some basic data manipulation with Base R and Dplyr with a small dataset
<br />

**Summary of Useful Dplyr functions**

## Data Exploration and Visualisation
**In the second lab session, the learning objectives are:**
<br />
- To be able to create data visualisation charts and frequency distribution tables through the manipulation of data
- Useful charts include: piecharts, barcharts, scatterplots and histograms
- Pareto Analysis of Dataset
<br />

## Statistical Measures and Probability
**In the third lab session, the learning objectives are:**
<br />
- To be able to generate descriptive statistics using R
- To be able to generate tables and charts to display the descriptive statistics of one or more variables. 
- To be able to interpret the descriptive statistics generated
- To be able to assess if a variable is normally distributed
- To be able to perform outlier analyses
- To be able to compute proportions
- To be able to compute probabilities of events that approximate the normal distribution, given population parameters
<br />

## Sample & Estimation and Hypothesis Testing
**In the fourth lab session, the learning objectives are:**
<br />
- To be able to compute and interpret confidence intervals for means and proportion 
- To be able to compute and interpret prediction intervals
